## **Our Purpose**
Welcome to the Neudesic Solution Center of Columbus. Our purpose is to improve the world we live in, one code-commit at a time. We do this by delivering amazing outcomes for our clients and by being a positive force for everyone we interact with. We believe that to achieve extraordinary results, we must change the way we act and the way we think.
## **We are Inspired by Values, Guided by Principles**
Our values and principles help us achieve the common purpose. When we face difficult challenges, shared beliefs anchor us and give us direction when navigating uncertainty or ambiguity. 
### **Passion** 
We are relentless in the development and application of our craft. Each day presents us with an opportunity to learn and grow:grow- as a firm,; as a team;, and as individuals. When things get difficult, we increase our intensity and celebrate achievement because we persevered. And we never stop looking for ways to improve our processes, designs, and skills.
### **Discipline**
We have high standards for quality of software delivery. We follow a regimented training routine and continuously refine our skills. We do the little things like track our work, follow DevOps best practices, and check-in our code on a regular basis. Every deadline is critical, but we don’t take short-term fixes that create long-term problems. 
### **Integrity** 
Truthfulness and sincerity form the foundation of our relationships with each other and with our clients. We are always genuine and honest, especially when it is hard. We know that when trust is lost, so is the mission.lost trust, we have lost the mission.
### **Teaming**
Teams start and finish together; success and failure are shared. We value collaboration and detest ‘hero culture’. When one of our teammates struggles, we empathetically help them overcome their challenge with support and encouragement. We put aside or ego and always look to do the right thing to achieve our outcome.
### **Innovation**
The technology industry is in a constant state of flux and we actively explore new and novel ways to solve problems. Our solutions differentiate our firm from the status quo and we deliberately refine our skills to meet the demand. We apply our new skills to solve our clientsclient’s problems.

**Guiding Principles** 

These values can be realized through a guiding set of principles which we find non-negotiable. 

1. **Client Obsession** – all solutions should begin with solving our clients’ most important problems, never lose sight of the outcome we are trying to achieve for them.

1. **Start Together, Finish Together** – software delivery is a team sport and every team member are ofis a part of each phase in the delivery cycle- requirements, design, development, and testing

1. **Better Every Day** – if a system is left in inertia, entropy and decay will set in; apply a little bit of improvement energy each day.

1. **Automation of Toil** – we automate repeatable, mundane tasks for code generation, build, test, and deployment.

1. *Collaborate Cross-functionally***Two People on One Commit** – code reviews are a force multiplier in software development; they cultivate shares ownership and understanding, increase team skills and capabilities, and reduce defects and riskwe don’t work in a vacuum. By working with others, we cross-pollenate ideas and skills.s

1. *Real-Time Feedback* – the reward or reprimand should be close to the incident. We should be quick to compliment and constructively critique one another.

1. **Commitment to Quality?**


## **We are Committed to Your Growth**
This is not a job, but a step in your career path. We are your partner and helping you achieve operational control and technical excellence. You will be empowered and motivated with: 

- Autonomy- You are your manager. Given firm objectives team goals, you will control when and how you meet them.
- Mastery- You have tremendous potential for growth. Train
- Purpose- You are part of something bigger than yourself. Find meaning in your work and have a positive impact on the world.
### **What We Do Different**
Many consulting firms are singularly focused on utilization targets for their people. We are different because we limit your billable hours so that you can develop yourself and your team. You will design and execute your personal training plans and use spare capacity to create pioneering results. 

We measure client success at the team level using multiple variables. Our primary metric is client satisfaction: would the client recommend us to colleagues, friends, and family? Our secondary metrics are speed and safety: what are the team’s throughput, lead time, cycle time, change failure rate, and incident recovery time?

We are a learning culture and knowledge is shared throughout the solution center. We learn together and share what we learn through day-to-day activities like code reviews as well as focused times like lunch-and-learns and innovation activities.
### **Continual Coaching**
We practice real-time feedback in a networked fashion. When a teammate does something awesome, we recognize it immediately; when a teammate needs coaching we address things in a timely manner. The coaching process happens in every direction, not in a hierarchical, top-down manner; if your manager makes a mistake, youryou are expected to provide constructive feedback. 

**How We Measure Success**

Should we list out what in individual success looks like?

Should we list out the metrics we use (Cycle Time, Change Failure Rate, etc)

**DevOps**

Should we describe that we follow this to a T? We don’t have to include training, just a statement.
