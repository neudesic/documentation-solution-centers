# Process and Guidelines

### Process
Unless a clear and concise answer is available, questions should originate in the General channel where we as a team can have a conversation and gather as much information as possible to create a clear answer to the question. once we feel we have agood answer, we will move it into the FAQ.

### Guidelines
1. Please try to keep your Questions and Answers short and to the point, we want to give concise helpful information as quickly as possible!
2. If you see an Answer that needs updated, please either update it, or flag it to the solution center so we can make the changes, we don't want false information within the FAQ. 
3. Please don't post an answer unless you are confident of its accuracy. THe process should be to start questions in the general channel, and once an adequate answer has been provided it can be moved into the FAQ Wiki. 
4. The FAQ is broken into categories, Please do your best to keep things organized, and where needed create new categories, but be mindful or creating to many buckets. 
5. Please create a new section (not page) for each question added. This will help keep the best possible search ability and organization

### Company Policies

<details>
<summary> Time-Off Policy </summary>

Per Neudesic's time-off policy, Neudesic does not limit the amount of paid time off employees can take for vacation and for short term, limited absences, but employees are still obliged to:
* Communicate and collaborate with their team to ensure everyone takes leave without disrupting operations
* Plan to delegate, postpone or otherwise manage projects that will be affected by their time off
* Agreement with their Leads of taking time off in advance
* Give a 30 day notice on vacation time

Please note that this benefit is not a form of additional compensation and employees don’t accrue time off. This also means that if you do not take time off in one year, it doesn’t carry over to the next year. Neudesic does not compensate for “unused leave,” because there is no specified amount of time off. This time-off policy doesn’t interfere with legally established leaves like maternity and paternity leave under the FMLA and is not to be used during a leave of absence provided by law.
