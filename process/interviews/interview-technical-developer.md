# Technical Screening

The goals of the technical screen are three-fold

1. Assessing a candidate&#39;s ability to reason through and solve complicated problems
2. Assessing a candidate&#39;s aptitude for technical growth
3. Assessing a candidate&#39;s ability to talk about/communicate and teach complicated material to a technical and non-technical audience.

# Code Review Questions

As is the case in all interview situations, the more conversational you can keep the interview, the better. For the code review, your goal should be to hear and see how the interviewee thinks through and explains code that they are seeing. Rather than quizzing them on the code they are seeing, ask them to look through the code and explain their thought processes out loud.

As the candidate is reviewing the code sample here are some questions to help guide the conversation.

1. Walk me through this code
2. Are you happy with your solution to the problem?
3. (If candidate if presenting their own code) ï¿½ Where did you get stuck? How did you get past it?
4. I see you used Module X here. How would you solve this problem without Module X?
5. (Where applicable) If your data file was several orders of magnitude larger (say, 1 TB), would this code still work? Why or why not? What would you do differently?
6. What would you do differently if you had a significantly longer period of time to work on this problem?

# Code Agnostic Questions

1. Problem Solving
   1. &quot;Let&#39;s say your team is working for the Public Building Service, an arm of the GSA that is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all government buildings. They&#39;ve asked you to create a feature where a building inspector can upload photos of their building inspection findings so they can document them visually and ensure issues are fixed. How would you approach the design and build for this?&quot;
   2. &quot;Tell me about a difficult technical problem that you helped solve: what was the problem, and how was it solved?&quot;
2. Maintainable Software Development
   1. &quot;What does refactoring mean to you? Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?&quot;
   2. &quot;Tell me about your approach to software testing. Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?&quot;
3. Technical Communication / Ability to teach
   1. Pick a foundational web development concept or technology and explain it at two levels: first as you would to a colleague who&#39;s not a software developer, like a designer or product manager; next, as you would to a peer.
4. DevOps
   1. &quot;You&#39;re tasked with writing a guide for developers about ensuring high reliability for a web application. What topics would you cover?&quot;
