4. **Tell me about a time when you worked with a colleague who was not doing their share of the work. How did you handle it?**

_Project Management (Senior/Team Lead)_

1. How do you determine if a task or project is at risk?

Team leaders have a responsibility to communicate team goals. They must ensure work is completed by the deadline and at the quality level that&#39;s expected by upper management and customers. This question lets you see how Candidates monitor tasks and projects, identify issues and make certain the team is helping the company achieve its main goals.

**What to look for in an answer:**

    - Candidate&#39;s ability to communicate expectations and collaborate with team members
    - Critical thinking and problem-solving skills
    - Management style

**Example:**&quot;First, I communicate work expectations clearly to team members, being sure to highlight everything that&#39;s been communicated to me from managers and executives. This reduces the chance of failure. Second, throughout a task or project, I monitor key performance indicators to see if the team is on schedule, within budget and producing quality work. I also ask that team members maintain constant communication with me throughout the project. This allows me to anticipate and identify problems before they arise and reduce any negative effects.&quot;

1. What metrics do you use to evaluate team performance?

Team leaders are not just expected to generate and share detailed performance reports with the team and company management. They should also know how to use data-driven insights to boost team efficiency. Look for answers that show a team leader won&#39;t rely on instinct to make decisions but rather will examine the numbers to determine the best solutions and changes to increase performance.

**What to look for in an answer:**

    - Candidate&#39;s method for improving team performance
    - Knowledge of performance metrics
    - Opinion of data-driven approaches

**Example:**&quot;Given all the data we have today, it&#39;s essential that team leaders analyze and extract insights from that data to increase effectiveness. My opinion is that the metrics a team focuses on should strongly link to a company&#39;s strategic objectives. In a general sense, I always look at quantity, quality and time. For instance, to measure the quality of work, it&#39;s important to look at the number of errors and customer satisfaction. Another thing I measure is employee morale and engagement because those can make or break a team.&quot;

_Team Management (Senior/Team Lead)_

1. What do you do if there&#39;s a disagreement within your team?

The success of a team often depends on the ability of its leaders to get everyone working together towards a common goal. A lack of unity can lead to failure. With this question, you can gain an understanding of how the Candidate would handle the situation successfully and move the team in a positive direction.

**What to look for in an answer:**

- Candidate&#39;s decision-making and problem-solving approach
- Conflict management and resolution skills
- Opinion on the value of teamwork

**Example:**&quot;Disagreements can happen, especially when people have strong opinions over the way a task should be done. I would first ask the team members to take a step back. I would then lead a team discussion so that we can all understand each other&#39;s point of view. If appropriate, I would negotiate a compromise that would put the team in the best position for success. If there is clearly a right way to handle the situation, I will explain why we&#39;re choosing one solution over the other.&quot;

1. Describe your leadership style.

When you hire a team leader for our business, you want to ensure they have a strategy in place for overseeing their employees. Many team leaders subscribe to a specific leadership style, while others create their own with clear and effective tenants of their own choosing. Regardless of what leadership style our potential candidates employ, the candidate should be able to clearly explain it to you.

**What to look for in an answer:**

- Describes a specific leadership style or strategy
- Provides evidence of success
- Highlights values that align with Neudesic&#39;s

**Example:**&quot;I tend to lean towards a democratic leadership style when establishing a new team. After a few months, I become a bit more laissez-faire in my leadership style as my employees become more accomplished in their roles. I&#39;ve found in my past experience that most employees do best when you get out of the way and give them the space they need to do their work independently. I&#39;m always present, however, and implement regular check-ins, both formal and informal, to ensure my team has all the support and resources they need.&quot;

&quot;Knowing a bit about your company culture, I think this approach will work well. The innovative and creativity driven culture fits well with my leadership style.&quot;

## INTEGRITY

#### What is it?

Integrity is consistently adhering to moral and ethical values regardless of the benefits or consequences. Simply, it is doing the right thing regardless of the consequences.

#### What does it look like?

- Exercises meaningful judgement
- Understands how to build and maintain trust

#### Integrity Questions

1. What has you on the job market at this time?
2. What are you looking for in your new role/opportunity?
3. Tell me about a time you developed a feature for a user and, once delivered, it wasn&#39;t what they wanted. Where was the disconnect, and what did you learn from this experience?
4. Can you give me an example of how you&#39;ve contributed to the culture of previous teams, companies or groups?
5. What do you look for in an employer?
  1. The best answer to this question would highlight the overlap between the candidate&#39;s passion and Neudesic&#39;s objectives. Look for signs of self-awareness, thoughtful career goals and an appreciation for the needs of the company.

**What to look for in an answer:**

- Clearly articulated career goals
- Desire to contribute meaningfully
- Recognition of the role employees play in meeting company goals

# Technical Screening

The goals of the technical screen are three-fold

1. Assessing a candidate&#39;s ability to reason through and solve complicated problems
2. Assessing a candidate&#39;s aptitude for technical growth
3. Assessing a candidate&#39;s ability to talk about/communicate and teach complicated material to a technical and non-technical audience.

# Code Review Questions

As is the case in all interview situations, the more conversational you can keep the interview, the better. For the code review, your goal should be to hear and see how the interviewee thinks through and explains code that they are seeing. Rather than quizzing them on the code they are seeing, ask them to look through the code and explain their thought processes out loud.

As the candidate is reviewing the code sample here are some questions to help guide the conversation.

1. Walk me through this code
2. Are you happy with your solution to the problem?
3. (If candidate if presenting their own code) – Where did you get stuck? How did you get past it?
4. I see you used Module X here. How would you solve this problem without Module X?
5. (Where applicable) If your data file was several orders of magnitude larger (say, 1 TB), would this code still work? Why or why not? What would you do differently?
6. What would you do differently if you had a significantly longer period of time to work on this problem?

How would you approach the design and build for this?&quot;
  2. &quot;Tell me about a difficult technical problem that you helped solve: what was the problem, and how was it solved?&quot;
2. Maintainable Software Development
  1. &quot;What does refactoring mean to you? Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?&quot;
  2. &quot;Tell me about your approach to software testing. Why is it important and when have you done it? Where does it belong in the process?&quot;
3. Technical Communication / Ability to teach
  1. Pick a foundational web development concept or technology and explain it at two levels: first as you would to a colleague who&#39;s not a software developer, like a designer or product manager; next, as you would to a peer.
4. DevOps
  1. &quot;You&#39;re tasked with writing a guide for developers about ensuring high reliability for a web application. What topics would you cover?&quot;
