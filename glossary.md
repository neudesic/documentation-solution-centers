## General Terms
#### AGILE / Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.

#### API
"Application Program Interface." How computers and applications communicate with one another.

#### Application
Also known as an app, these are programs designed to perform functions. This includes mobile apps.

#### Attribute
Information about elements of a component in your website design/build.

#### Back End
All of the behind-the-scenes digital operations that it takes to keep the front end of a website running, such as the coding, style, and plugins. If the front end of your website is what the audience sees onstage, the back end encompasses the stagehands, makeup artists, costumers, tech crew, stage managers, etc. simultaneously running the show from backstage.

#### Cache
The storage of certain elements to help with faster load times from repeat website visitors. Often developers will tell you to clear your browser’s cache if they make a change on the website that you can’t see — most likely your cache is holding onto an older version and hasn’t made room for the new one yet. (Kind of like that period of time between you moving to college and your parents converting your childhood bedroom into a home-office–slash–exercise-room.)

#### Classes
In CSS, an identifier for specifying exactly what you what to target with styling.
In other programming languages, classes are a bit more broadly used as the blueprint for creating something — similar to using the blueprint of an existing car to create a new type of car.

#### CMS
“Content Management System.” The program that you use to create and maintain your website’s content. These are usually designed for non-developers for ease-of-use. Our personal favorite at Whole Whale is WordPress.

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous integration is a practice where developers constantly add their code to the main system. Developers work independently on a feature. Once a feature is completed, it’s tested for any bugs. 

Only after it’s passed the automated test is it added to the final software.

#### Cookies
This is the data sent by an Internet server to a browser. Each time the browser accesses the same server, it sends the data back as a means of tracking how (and how often) it accesses the server. This is why your home computer always knows your Netflix login.

#### CRM
"Customer Relationship Management" In website development this refers to the software and applications used to gather, analyze, and maintain information on customers, donors, and prospects.

#### CSS
"Cascading Style Sheet" Code that tells browsers how to display a webpage for the end user. This programming formats fonts, colors, and other visual elements. When redeveloping a website, editing these elements in the mockup/GUI phase is much easier than changing in CSS.

#### DevOps
"Development Operations." System of working that helps to keep development, IT operations, and quality assurance departments on the same page to make for better end-products and collaborations.

#### Firewall
System to protect a secure network from an unsecure network (i.e., the rest of the Internet).

#### Framework
Suite of programs used in website or software development. This lays the groundwork for the type of programming language used for your site or app development.

#### Front End
The part of the website or app that the user sees. If the back end of your website is everything behind-the-scenes, this is what happens onstage.

#### GUI
"Graphical User Interface" The image of how a website is laid out and meant to be interacted with. In website design, this is how everything will ideally look in layout (your mileage may vary when you move into development given the number of different browsers and versions).

#### Kanban
Instead of working in fixed and planned iterations like in Scrum, Kanban teams work on priority tasks whenever they come in. The goal of Kanban is to have a constant stream of work without any bottlenecks. 

#### Kanban board
A Kanban board visualizes all the work within the project. 

It’s a physical or virtual board that is split into 3-4 columns. 

Each column in a Kanban board represents a status of the task, ranging from 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. 

In Kanban, each task is visualized as a sticky note or card. Every time a team member finishes a task, the card is moved to the relevant column.

#### Plugin
Modules or software that can be added (“plugged in”) to a system for added functionality or features.

#### Refactoring
A programming practice where Agile software development teams 'clean up' the code by:

* Removing redundant pieces of code
* Edit out unnecessary functions
* The result is a simpler code that could be understood by any developer.

**Note:** Refactoring doesn'’'t change how the code works; it just improves its internal structure and architecture.

#### Responsive Design
Websites that accommodate the screen on which they’re being viewed. This became a huge trend in website design when browsing on mobile and tablet devices became more popular, which has led many developers to opt for a “mobile-first” approach — optimizing a website design for phone and tablet use first and then making sure it looks good on a laptop/desktop.

#### SAAS Platforms
"Software As A Service" The most basic of cloud platforms; allows users to share files and collaborate on projects through their browser. Some SAAS platforms include Google Drive and Dropbox. Other cloud options are Platform as a Service (PAAS; Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS; Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure).

#### Server
Computers running software that allows users to access your website — this is what houses the hosting. If your domain is the website’s mailing address and the hosting is its house, the server is the land it’s built on.

#### UI
"User Interface" The visual elements that go into a website or app. This is the form to UX’s function.

#### Waterfall Methodology
The traditional "waterfall" approach has one discipline contribute to the project, then "throw it over the wall" to the next contributor, agile calls for collaborative cross-functional teams. Open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile. Although the project lead or product owner typically prioritizes the work to be delivered, the team takes the lead on deciding how the work will get done, self-organizing around granular tasks and assignments.

#### Wireframe
The bare bones structure of a website. No fonts, colors, or images, this layout is the first step to making sure that the foundation is sound before content is added.

## Success Vectors
#### Emotional Intelligence
Being aware that emotions can drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively) and learning how to manage those emotions – both our own and others.

#### Financial Stewardship
Spending resources wisely. Resources include time, money, people, and property. Financial consequences are evaluated before existing activities are changed or eliminated and new activities begins.

#### Operational Clarity
The ability to clearly define our vision, mission, strategy, opportunities, challenges, and priorities across the entire enterprise.

#### Technical Excellence
Sub-vectors include software design and engineering, development hygiene, multi-discipline like web, APIs (Application Programming Interface), data, cloud, etc.

## Agile Methodology
#### Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are a set of conditions that software must meet in order to be accepted by a customer or stakeholder.

#### Acceptance Test
An acceptance test ensures that a software feature is working correctly and meets the acceptance criteria. It’s usually run after the software has been developed. 

#### Agile Software Development
Agile Software Development is a project management technique that allows developers to create a working software model in just a few weeks.

An Agile team breaks down in their project into smaller development cycles called iterations or sprints.

At the end of the iteration, the Agile team is able to deliver working software with just the essential features. Users give their feedback and suggestions, and the Agile team includes it in future iterations.

#### Backlog
A list of new product features, updates, bug fixes, etc. that are required by the user.

At the start of every iteration, the product owner decides which backlog items the team needs to work on. After every iteration, the backlog is regularly updated with user suggestions and new features. 

#### Backlog Refinement or Backlog Grooming
A Scrum meeting where the Scrum team organizes the backlog to make sure it’s ready for the next sprint or iteration.  It is normally held at the end of the sprint. Here’s what the team does during this meeting: 

* Removes unnecessary user stories
* Creates new user stories based on user feedback
* Prioritizes features that must be included in the next sprint

#### Bottleneck
Issues that can slow down the development process.  A bottleneck occurs when too many tasks are stuck at one stage, like a traffic jam of project tasks.

#### Burndown Chart
An important chart that helps Agile project managers track:

* The amount of work left in the project
* The time remaining to complete the work

#### Daily Scrum (Stand-up Meeting)
It’s a daily meeting usually hosted by the Scrum master or designated team member. Every morning, the Scrum team gets together for 15 minutes to discuss their day ahead. 

Each member briefly talks about the following topics:

* What they plan to do today 
* What they did yesterday
* Issues they have encountered
* The Scrum master steps up to solve any impediments the Scrum team might have.

#### Epics
An epic is a big idea or feature that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Much like how large 'epics' like Lord of the Rings are split into 3 books or movies.

Each user story, in turn, can be broken into manageable tasks. 

#### Impediment
It’s an obstacle that reduces an Agile team’s productivity or prevents them from completing an Agile project altogether.

#### Iteration
It’s a period of time in which an Agile team needs to develop working software. An iteration generally lasts for around 2-4 weeks for Kanban and Scrum teams.

#### Kanban
Instead of working in fixed and planned iterations like in Scrum, Kanban teams work on priority tasks whenever they come in. The goal of Kanban is to have a constant stream of work without any bottlenecks. 

#### Product Backlog
A list of new features, updates, bug fixes, etc. that are required by the user. The product owner is in charge of prioritizing items in the product backlog. They decide every product backlog item the team needs to work on at the beginning of each iteration.

#### Product Manager
A person who assists the Agile team with the development process from start to finish. 

Their main responsibilities include:

* dealing with problems in the development process
* ensuring the team meets project deadlines
* collaborating with other departments of the company like sales, marketing and, customer service

**Note:** Product manager and Product owner are not interchangeable Agile terms. 

#### Product Owner
A person who decides the vision and features of the final software. They carefully understand the customer’s needs and requirements and add those items to the product backlog.  They also receive feedback from the customers and relay it to the development team.

#### Scrum
4n Agile methodology in which a team works in short bursts of work ranging from 2-4 weeks, called sprints. At the end of the sprint, they deliver the product to the customers, and in turn, the customers give the developers their feedback.

#### Scrum Board
A virtual or physical board that displays tasks that need to be done in a sprint. The Scrum board is almost identical to a Kanban board. Unlike a Kanban board, the Scrum board doesn’t have a limit on the number of tasks that can be in one column simultaneously.

#### Scrum Master
The leader of the Scrum. They organize meetings, remove impediments, and work with the product owner to ensure that the product backlog is up to date.

#### Scrum Meeting
A Scrum meeting is an essential part of the Scrum framework. Without them, the sprint would have no structure or project plan in place! 

There are five types of Scrum meetings that occur during the sprint.  Each Scrum meeting enables the whole team to do important sprint tasks like:

* Create a plan for the sprint in a sprint planning meeting
* Solve problems together in the Daily Scrum
* Organize the backlog in the backlog refinement meeting
* Demonstrate a working software to the customer in a sprint review
* Analyze the sprint performance in a sprint retrospective

#### Scrum team
A cross-functional team of 5-10 individuals with different skill sets ranging from graphic design, UX, coding, etc. They work together to develop a product under the Scrum framework. Each Scrum team usually contains 3 key roles:

* Product owner
* Scrum master
* Developers

#### Sprint
Another term for an iteration. However, sprint is a Scrum term and is usually a phrase used by Scrum teams. 

Another difference between the two is that sprints maintain a uniform length (2-4 weeks) during the Agile development process. Whereas, iterations can have varying lengths, depending on the nature of the work.

#### Sprint Backlog
A list of features, bug fixes, user requirements, and tasks that the Scrum team needs to work on during the sprint.

During the sprint planning meeting, the product owner decides the backlog items need to be added to the sprint backlog. 

#### Sprint Planning
A Scrum meeting where the Scrum team decides the work they need to do during the sprint.  This includes picking up items (like user stories) from the sprint backlog and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

#### Sprint Retrospective
A Scrum meeting where the Scrum team analyzes their performance, at the end of the sprint.  The team uses Agile metrics, charts, and reports to see where they excel and where they need to improve.

#### Sprint Review
A Scrum meeting where the Scrum team demonstrates a working software model to the stakeholders. 

Along with the product demo, the Scrum team prepares a presentation that outlines the new features added, bug fixes, and other changes.

At the end of the review, the stakeholder provides valuable feedback, which is implemented in the next sprint. 

#### Stakeholder
Anyone outside of the Agile team who is connected to the project. It could be an investor, account manager, sales team, or the client.

#### Story Points
It’s a measure of effort that your team would need to complete project tasks (user story). The time taken to complete the simplest user story is taken as the baseline and is given 1 point. Other user stories are assigned story points proportional to the baseline. 

For example, if a feature that takes 2 hours to develop is given 1 point, then a feature that takes 4 hours receives 2 points.

#### User Story
It’s a brief description of a specific product feature or a function that customers would find helpful. A user story looks something like this: 

As (user name/type), I want to (do a thing), so I can (achieve a goal).

#### Work item
An Agile term that refers to the different types of work that needs to be done within the project. Here are a few examples:

* User Story
* Task 
* Bug fixes
* Epics

#### Velocity
A unit of measurement that determines the amount of work your team can handle during an iteration. 

It’s measured by calculating the average number of tasks/user stories completed in a sprint. Agile teams use a velocity chart to do this.
