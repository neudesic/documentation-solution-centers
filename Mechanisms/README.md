# Alchemy Overview

The Alchemy Project is a crucible used to create Neudesic Labs.

> Alchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e.g., lead) into "noble metals" (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ("Great Work"). The concept of creating the philosophers' stone was variously connected with all of these projects.

## The Solution Center Internship <a name="Internship"></a>

<br />

### **Introduction** <a name="Introduction"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solution Center Internship Program is designed around two core objectives: Candidates are hired after graduation and ready for work on day one. We strive to achieve these objectives through a three-tier mentorship program and vocational project. The program is centered around a mentality of hands-on learning and meant to be technically challenging, while also fun and engaging for the candidate. The Program boasts a high touch point curriculum, with tight feedback loops and ample learning opportunities.

### **Business Challenge** <a name="TheBusinessChallenge"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business challenge that the Solution Center Internship Program addresses is the need for full-stack software developers trained on the Solution Center software delivery standards and hired upon Program closure, ready for work on day one.
<br />

### **Inputs** <a name="Input"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inputs to the Solution Center Internship Program are the candidates. The ideal candidate is a college student rounding the corner on graduation (within a year), but other candidates will be considered on a case by case basis.

<br />

### **Tools** <a name="Tools"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internship Program utilizes two main tools for transforming candidates into the skilled full-stack software developers we are looking for:

1. A three-tier mentorship program which can be found HERE(LINK TBD)
2. A vocational project which can be found HERE (Link TBD) guided by the Playbook which can be found HERE (Link TBD)

<br />

### **Adoption** <a name="Adoption"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internship Program should be adopted by all Solution Center teams as a means for recruiting new resources. The main barriers to adoption are time and proper understating. These barriers are addressed by designing a program that spreads responsibility across multiple individuals to ease the time commitment, as well as creating detailed documentation and training resources for those who intend to execute the program.

<br />

### **Inspection** <a name="Inspection"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspection will be a shared responsibility between the owners of the program, namely the Internship Committee, and the respective corporate stakeholders. Inspection will occur on multiple cadences:

1. A weekly basis for fast feedback loops in the form of Internship Committee meetings. During these meetings, members of the committee will review the backlog/current action items, as well as review feedback from in progress programs.
2. A monthly internship MBR. In this meeting, the Internship Committee will review progress on OKR's, status of key success metrics, and actions items moving forward for continuous improvement of the program with its corporate stakeholders.
3. A post program retro. At the end of each iteration of the Internship Program, the committee and its corporate stakeholders will meet to discuss success of the iteration. Feedback from the program participants and overall success metrics will be evaluated. New goals will be set for further iterations of the program and any necessary action items will be recorded in the backlog.

The key metrics that the program will be measured against are:

1. The retention rate of the candidates in the program, i.e. The percentage of people being hired as a result of the program.
2. The readiness of candidates for work on day one as Associates.
   - The standard that internship candidates are held to for day one readiness is higher than that of a normal associate because of the higher investment. For the purposes of the Internship Program, ready on day one is defined as a developer who understands the technical and organizational capabilities outlined in The Playbook.
   - \*\*The expectation is not that the candidate posses mastery of these topics, but rather that the candidate understands and can recognize where these items fit into the software development process, why they are important, and has hands-on exposure to them at least once. The goal is a baseline understanding of right and wrong, as well as a starting point for the core competences we expect out of developers at Neudesic.
   - \*\* This is quantified by the confidence we have in the candidate and the confidence the candidates has in themselves. It's not about knowing details; it's about having the confidence to take on tasks and knowing where to findÂ resources.

<br />

### **Iteration** <a name="Iteration"></a>

Based on the results of the above inspection cadences, the Internship Committee will be responsible for logging action items and iterating on the program to provide continuous improvement.

<br />

### **Output** <a name="Output"></a>

The output of the Internship Program are Associate Developers who are trained in the core competencies (as outlined by The Playbook) and are ready on day one to be contributing members of a Solution Center Software Delivery Team.
