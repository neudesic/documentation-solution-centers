## Meeting Minutes

- We opened the meeting with a review of the agenda.
  1. Review Internship Mechanism
  2. Review Internship OKR's
  3. Review Internship Backlog and Process Moving Forward
- Reviewed the internship Mechanism
  - Feedback on business Challenge
    - The business challenge needs to be slightly more specific to the internship. It should include reference to our key metrics of Retention and Ready on day one as those are what set the program apart from other general recruiting programs.
  - Feedback on Tools
    - There should probably be a tool that captures sour metrics for retention/program referrals. We need a way to measure our success rate in recruiting. Is the internship driving recruiting?
  - Adoption
    - Made the point that we are focusing on internal adaption, but the program is open to expansion.
  - Feedback on Inspection
    - The ready on day one metric needs a way to be concretely measured. Right now is a little too subjective. We need a way to test/certify that the candidates are actually learning the knowledge passed on throughout the program.
- Reviewed OKR's
  - Need to refine down to 1-2 OKR's.
  - Keep things a little more focused.
  - Add in organizational Alignment for the ORK's
- Reviewed Backlog and Next Steps
  - Immediate Next Steps are
    1. To solidify what the sumner program looks like as we intend to bring on 1 candidate for the summer.
    2. To build out the technical curriculum for the Internship program which will in turn inform which items need to be worked on in The Playbook
