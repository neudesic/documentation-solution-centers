# Internship Internal Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this document is to outline the internal processes of the Internship Program to ensure mentors are staying aligned and fast feedback loops are present.

## On-Boarding (Weeks 0-1)

This process will follow the Solution Center's general on-boarding, consisting of the following:

1. Pre-Program Call **(Peer Mentor, Intern)**: The selected Peer Mentors will call each of their respective interns one week before the Program begins. This time will be used to introduce each other and answer/forward any questions interns may have. Additionally, Peer Mentors should use this call as a way to get the interns excited to begin their journey with Neudesic.

2. Welcome Call **(Solution Center)**: A time for the interns to meet the team; same as what we do with new hires. The Solution Center Recruiter(s) will add this meeting to the calendar.

3. On-boarding Chat **(Peer Mentor, Intern)**: Each Peer Mentor will set up time to connect with their interns during day 1. This time will be used to unblock any issues with on-boarding. The goal here is to streamline the process to get interns ready to work as soon as possible.

4. First Mentor Chat **(Peer Mentor, Technical Mentor, Career Mentor, Intern)**:

   1. Introduce each other and describe how the 3-tier mentorship process is structured.

   2. Introduce the Internship Project: Talk through and show examples of the lunch 'n learn & final presentation, as well possible ideas for the project. If the intern knows what they want to do, you can start to form a rough draft of OKR's around their project. A good exercise will be to try and get them to ask questions to start the brainstorming process.

5. OKR Chat **(Technical Mentor, Intern)**: During this week (ideally within the first 3 days), each Technical Mentor will set up time to discuss OKRs with their interns. The outcome of this touch point will be a defined set of OKRs that the intern can begin to progress against.

## During the internship (Weeks 2-11)

There will be numerous ad-hoc touch points between mentors, SC personnel, and interns, but the following will be a set of defined cadences.

1. Weekly One-on-One **(Technical Mentor, Intern)**: While the Technical Mentor and intern will meet regularly for the project, this specific touch point will be used to leave feedback around coaching and the Program. It also allows the Technical Mentor to course correct the intern as needed.

   1. Written Artifact: The written artifact should include a recap of the week for the intern, major milestones reached, and progression in the Program. It should also include a record of any feedback given to the intern and vice-versa on program enhancements. Remember, this is essentially a 12-week interview for the intern. These artifacts will become the evidence we use to make a hiring decision at the end of the Program. These artifacts will be based on a fillable template to maintain uniformity.

2. Bi-Weekly One-on-One **(Career Mentor, Intern)**: This time will be used for each Career Mentor to connect with their interns, starting the first week of the Program. There is no specific agenda, but these touchpoints will mainly focus around the tenants outlined for the Career Mentor (i.e. building a career in Software, consulting skills, etc).

   1. Written Artifact: *TBD: We decided we probably need to add some type of artifact and will explore the format and a template for this that allows for personal conversation and a place where trust is built, but we can still record action items and things that need to be memorialized. We need to make sure this format is not intrusive on trust. We want the intern to feel comfortable talking about anything including their weaknesses without fear of it being recorded and held against them.*

3. Weekly Retro w/ Mentors **(All Mentors)**: This will be used as a time to share feedback received from interns and collectively conduct a retro on the process. It's also a time for mentors to share advice on handling situations, progress and feedback on their interns.

   1. Written Artifact: This meeting will produce a weekly artifact in the form of a retro board with Liked Learned Loathed and Longed For, as well as any action items for the following week.

4. Weekly Feedback Survey: Anonymous Survey sent out Friday with one question around general program satisfaction and a place for the interns to leave feedback about the Program.

## End of Internship (Week 12)

1. Final Presentation **(Solution Center, Corporate Sponsor, Intern)**: Each intern will also hold a presentation on their project as a whole. This will give time to show off the hard work and growth attained over the Program. Each presentation should demonstrate the application, as well as a high-level overview of the processes and technologies used. The end of the presentation will be used to open a dialogue on the project and any feedback from attendees. 

2. Hiring Decision Meeting **(Corporate Sponsor, Recruiter(s), Mentors, Intern)**: During the last week of the Program, we will hold hiring sync meetings, much like the ones conducted after interviews for candidates.

   1. Prior to these meetings, the mentors should prepare a quick presentation of talking points to present their intern. This should very closely represent the forms filled out during interviews. Talk about strengths and weaknesses as they relate to our PDITI values and any other categories used in the SC interview form. The group will then deliberate on a hiring decision.

3. Exit Interview **(Recruiter(s), Mentors, Intern)**: This is the final meeting with the intern for a possible offer and closing remarks.

   1. Before this meeting, the mentors will prepare a written final review outlining personal feedback for their intern. This should include positive feedback, as well as constructive criticism where applicable. This will be an artifact that they can take with them, outlining their journey and growth.

   2. During the meeting, the intern will receive a copy of the review. The mentors will take time to give a high-level overview of the feedback, allowing time to react and ask questions. This meeting will also serve as a time where a hiring decision will be passed along. In the case where we are hiring the intern, we will verbally pass the offer (offical offer will be sent at a later time) and answer any questions. In the case where we choose not to hire the intern, this is a time for us to pass along feedback about where we would like to see improvement and steps they could take to ready themselves for a job with Neudesic (if they wish to pursue further.)
