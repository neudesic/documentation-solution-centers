# Value Screening <a name="ValueScreening"></a>

During the value screening step, the interview team will ask the candidate behavioral questions and evaluate the answers against the Solution Center's core values and principles. The questions should be general and give the candidate plenty of flexibility in their answer. A few templates to utilize are:

- "Give me an example of..."
- "Tell me about a time...."
- "Describe an occasion when…."

A popular behavioral question is, "Give me an example of when you had to deal with a difficult customer." Use the behavioral questions to distill the values and principles; resist the urge to ask things like "Tell me about a time where you were passionate" or "Give me an example of when you were disciplined."

# Evaluating A Candidate During A Values Screening 

Below is the list of our core values. Underneath each value you'll find:

Example: "An innovation should have practical applications. I try to make certain that whenever I design or innovate a product or service, my primary goal is for it to have a specific purpose and solve a problem that doesn't have an efficient solution yet."

2. Tell me about a time when you took an innovative approach to solve an issue.

Employer asks this question because they want to understand how candidates can apply innovative thinking to their problem-solving skills.

# Technical Screening <a name="TechnicalScreening"></a>

The goals of the technical screen are three-fold

1. Assessing a candidate's ability to reason through and solve complicated problems
2. Can the candidate take a seemingly large problem and break it down into manageable pieces? What is their attitude toward complexity?
3. Assessing a candidate's aptitude for technical growth
4. Not an assessment of the candidate's current state, but an assessment of where they could be after 3/6/12 months. Have they given evidence of upskilling? Was it self-guided?
5. Assessing a candidate's ability to talk about/communicate and teach complicated material to a technical and non-technical audience.

As a rule, the question of being a junior, mid-level, or senior developer doesn't have much to do with how many years of experience a given candidate has – a junior developer can even be older than a senior developer. It is partly a question of the knowledge and technical skills which candidates have acquired. But, above all, it has a lot to do with how a developer perceives their work, how they interact with their peers, and how they approach problems. In this sense, the label of junior, mid-level, or senior refers above all to a certain level of maturity.

# Intern Developer Main Requirements <a name="InternDeveloperRequirements"></a>

When it comes to intern level positions, the main requirement is that candidates can perform technical tasks independently and/or devise a solution before coming to their mentor. Frequently, the mindset of an intern developer revolves around just making the code work. Interns are not fully independent and will need to discuss how to implement certain elements of the project.

Remember that intern developers write fancy code, as they find it hard to write straightforward code. They will also need to review their finished code with a more senior software engineer. This also means that you can expect that interns won't understand all the nuances in a project, and they will make mistakes from time to time. Intern developers are not expected to design any part of the architecture of the software.

Expected Qualities:

- The real desire to develop and learn
- Willingness to learn from their own mistakes
- Ability to accept (constructive) criticism in a calm way
- Genuine energy and commitment

**Key Behavior Questions:**

- Took the initiative to solve a small, but significant issue
- Was able to support the team, even if though you disagreed with the team
- Was empathetic towards a new team member

**Additionally:**

- Possess some knowledge of the relevant programming language and technology stacks (HTML, CSS, Java, C#, Object Oriented Programming, Domain Driven Design, etc…)
- Have some knowledge of most of the processes involved in creating software
- Are very keen to learn more about everything involved in making software
- Can find solutions to small issues
- Can be productive in working on a specific feature of the product

# Code Review Questions <a name="CodeReviewQuestions"></a>

As is the case in all interview situations, the more conversational you can keep the interview, the better. For the code review, your goal should be to hear and see how the interviewee thinks through and explains code that they are seeing. Rather than quizzing them on the code they are seeing, ask them to look through the code and explain their thought processes out loud.

As the candidate is reviewing the code sample here are some questions to help guide the conversation.

1. Walk me through this code
2. What problem is this code trying to solve?
3. Are you happy with your solution to the problem?
4. Where did you get stuck? How did you get past it?
5. I see you used Module X here. How would you solve this problem without Module X?
6. What would you do differently if you had a significantly longer period of time to work on this problem?
