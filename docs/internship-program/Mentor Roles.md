# Mentor Roles

The purpose of this document is to outline the 3-Tiered approach to our mentorship process during the internship program.  

<br />

## Peer Mentor (Buddy) 

The Peer Mentor is a Junior or Associate Developer that will serve as a non-technical point of contact for the intern. The Internship Committee will select Peer Mentors from an application process that consists of a set of essay-style questions. 

### Responsibilities 

-   Reach out and introduce oneself to the intern one week before their assigned start date 

-   Meet with the intern on their first day to monitor the onboarding process and answer/direct any questions 

-   Be available for ad-hoc touchpoints with the intern to discuss the program and any non-technical questions that may come up. The goal of these touchpoints is to aid in building a sense of community and ensure that roadblocks have a plan of action. These should be informal and conversational based to create a relaxed environment that the intern feels comfortable particpating in.

-   Attend all Internship Program mentor meetings (*circumstances permitting*) 

### Requirements 

-   The Peer Mentorship candidate process does not have a baseline set of criteria that can be measured and compared against. Instead, essay-style questions will be used to gauge the effort and thought process of the candidate to determine fit in the Internship Program. The principles below will be used to evaluate each applicant: 

-   Demonstrates a desire to improve and grow the Solution Center for future success 

-   Demonstrates the capability to balance client and mentor work without a loss in quality 

-   Demonstrates a passion for teaming and working with others
