# Project Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interns at Neudesic will complete an "intern project." A cloud native software delivery project that runs the length of the internship and is focused on solving a problem.

## Project Goals

1. Give interns an opportunity to own a project from start to finish and use as a vehicle to show off their strengths and interests.
2. Teach software delivery as a tool for problem solving.
3. Create technical learning experience for interns.
4. Create technical learning experience for other developers in the solution center.

## The Prompt

_Solve a problem using the cloud._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An intentionally vague prompt that will afford interns significant flexibility when defining the scope of their project.

## Deliverables

1. One GitHub repository containing...
   1. The project code
   2. A README file containing a brief project description
2. One lunch 'n learn educating peers about a core technology used in the project
3. One lunch 'n learn reviewing the final project

## Project Procedures

1. Define the problem. See tips on problem identification.
2. Define an MVP. What is the simplest product that will address the problem statement?
3. Build a feature map, defining high level features and supporting user stories; all corresponding to relevant domains.
4. Move the feature map to a Kanban board so progress can be tracked.
5. Complete the cards!

# Project Tips

1. Collaborate
   1. Software is almost never delivered in a solo capacity.
2. Have a solid understanding of the problem being solved.
   1. Not a perfect resource but the concept is here. [What is problem identification?](https://www.cdc.gov/policy/polaris/policyprocess/problem-identification/index.html)
3. Identify stakeholders
   1. Who will use or be impacted by the solution?
4. Create a domain model
5. Track WIP on a Kanban board
   1. Break work down into vertical slices
